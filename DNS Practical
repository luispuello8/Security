# DNS Practical Lab Documentation

This lab demonstrates how to use `nslookup` to query different DNS record types, including **CNAME**, **A**, **MX**, and **TXT** records. Here are the commands and expected outputs for each query type.

---

## Prerequisites

- A working terminal (Linux/Mac or Windows with WSL)
- Basic knowledge of DNS record types

---

## Commands and Examples

### 1. Querying a CNAME Record

To find the CNAME (Canonical Name) record, which points a domain to another domain, use the `nslookup` command with the `--type=CNAME` flag.

**Command:**
```bash
nslookup --type=CNAME shop.website.thm
Expected Output:

yaml
Copy code
Server: 127.0.0.53
Address: 127.0.0.53#53

Non-authoritative answer:
shop.website.thm canonical name = shops.myshopify.com
2. Querying an A Record
The A (Address) record maps a domain name to an IPv4 address. Use nslookup with the --type=A flag.

Command:

bash
Copy code
nslookup --type=A website.thm
Expected Output:

yaml
Copy code
Server: 127.0.0.53
Address: 127.0.0.53#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name: website.thm
Address: 10.10.10.10
3. Querying an MX Record
MX (Mail Exchange) records specify the mail servers responsible for receiving email on behalf of the domain. The priority of the mail server is also included.

Command:

bash
Copy code
nslookup --type=MX website.thm
Expected Output:

yaml
Copy code
Server: 127.0.0.53
Address: 127.0.0.53#53

Non-authoritative answer:
website.thm mail exchanger = 30 alt4.aspmx.l.google.com
Priority Value: The number before the mail server name (30 in this case) indicates the priority. Lower numbers have higher priority.
4. Querying a TXT Record
TXT records contain text information associated with the domain, often used for verification purposes.

Command:

bash
Copy code
nslookup --type=TXT website.thm
Expected Output:

vbnet
Copy code
Server: 127.0.0.53
Address: 127.0.0.53#53

Non-authoritative answer:
website.thm text = "THM{7012BBA60997F35A9516C2E16D2944FF}"
TXT Record Value: This example output shows a typical verification token or identifier.
5. General DNS Lookup
For a general DNS lookup without specifying the record type, simply use nslookup with the domain name.

Command:

bash
Copy code
nslookup website.thm
Expected Output:

yaml
Copy code
Server: 127.0.0.53
Address: 127.0.0.53#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name: website.thm
Address: 10.10.10.10
Summary
In this lab, we covered how to:

Use nslookup to find various DNS records.
Understand the purpose of CNAME, A, MX, and TXT records.
Identify the priority in MX records and interpret TXT record values.
This information is useful for DNS troubleshooting and understanding how domain records work.
