# Network Simulator TCP Handshake with Router

This document outlines my experience with the network simulator lab, focusing on the TCP Handshake process across networks with a router. The goal was to understand the stages of the TCP Handshake and examine the network log entries as data is transmitted.

## Lab Overview

In this lab, the objective was to:
1. Deploy the static site associated with the network simulator.
2. Experiment with sending a **TCP packet** from **Computer 1** to **Computer 3**.
3. Capture the flag provided by the simulator after sending the packet.
4. Analyze the **Network Log** to identify the sequence of events and the number of **HANDSHAKE** entries.

**Note**: The lab requires the use of Chrome or Firefox to function correctly.

## Steps Taken

### Step 1: Access the Network Simulator
- Clicked on the "View Site" button to open the network simulator.

### Step 2: Sending a TCP Packet
- Selected **Computer 1** as the source and **Computer 3** as the destination.
- Initiated the TCP packet transmission.
- Observed each step of the packetâ€™s journey through the network, broken down into:
  - Establishing the connection (Three-Way Handshake)
  - Packet transmission
  - Closing the connection

### Step 3: Capture the Flag
- After successfully completing the TCP Handshake and sending the packet, a flag was revealed by the simulator.
- **Flag**: `THM{YOU'VE_GOT_DATA}`

### Step 4: Analyzing the Network Log
- Reviewed the network log entries to understand each part of the TCP Handshake and routing process.
- **Number of HANDSHAKE entries**: `5`

## Network Log Details

Here is a breakdown of the network log entries observed during the simulation:

1. **HANDSHAKE**: Starting TCP/IP Handshake between `computer1` and `computer3`.
2. **HANDSHAKE**: Sending SYN Packet from `computer1` to `computer3`.
3. **ROUTING**: `computer1` says `computer3` is not on my local network, sending to gateway: `router`.
4. **ARP REQUEST**: Who has `router`? Tell `computer1`.
5. **ARP RESPONSE**: Hey `computer1`, I am `router`.
6. **ARP REQUEST**: Who has `computer3`? Tell `router`.
7. **ARP RESPONSE**: Hey `router`, I am `computer3`.
8. **HANDSHAKE**: `computer3` received SYN Packet from `computer1`, sending SYN/ACK Packet to `computer1`.
9. **HANDSHAKE**: `computer1` received SYN/ACK Packet from `computer3`, sending ACK packet to `computer3`.
10. **HANDSHAKE**: `computer3` received ACK packet from `computer1`, Handshake Complete.
11. **TCP**: Sending TCP packet from `computer1` to `computer3`.
12. **TCP**: `computer3` received TCP Packet from `computer1`, sending ACK Packet to `computer1`.

## Answers to Lab Questions

- **Flag from the Network Simulator**: `THM{YOU'VE_GOT_DATA}`
- **Number of HANDSHAKE entries**: `5`

## Observations

- The network simulator provided a clear breakdown of each step in the TCP packet's transmission, which helped in understanding the Three-Way Handshake process and routing through a gateway.
- The log entries helped visualize the ARP requests and responses involved in finding the correct route, as well as each handshake step required to establish a TCP connection.

## Conclusion

The network simulator lab was a valuable exercise in visualizing TCP packet transmission, understanding the handshake process, and observing the roles of ARP and routing in network communication.
